*Note that additional documentation can be found alongside individual methods in the source code.*

## Example usage

To start, all usage of `vimbaPy` should begin with the following:

``` python

from vimbaPy import _pymba, _VimbaPython

# For pymba:
cameras = _pymba.getCameraID() # Retrieve the ID's of all connected cameras.
cam = cameras[0] # Select the first camera

cam_P = _pymba.createInstance(cam) # Create an independent instance of vimbaPy using pymba

# For VimbaPython
cameras = _VimbaPython.getCameraID() 
cam = cameras[0]

cam_VP = _VimbaPython.createInstance(cam) # Same as above except with VimbaPython

```

This creates an independent instance for operating a given camera, in this case the first connected camera. Using this instance, we can then call further operations for this camera:

``` python

# Stream live footage from the camera for 10 seconds
cam_P.stream(time=10, frame_buffer=10, callback=cam_P.display) # using pymba
cam_VP.stream(time=10, frame_buffer=10, callback=cam_VP.display) # using VimbaPython

```

Using this workflow we can streamline acquisition projects like so:

``` python

from vimbaPy import _pymba

cameras = _pymba.getCameraID()
cam = cameras[0]

# Create an instance set to save frames in 'testFrames'
cam_P = _pymba.createInstance(cameraID=cam, path="/home/z/Documents/testFrames/")

# And stream frames to disk for 10 seconds
cam_P.stream(time=10, frame_buffer=10, callback=cam_P.export)

```

Note that we can specify different arguments at whichever stage we choose, so if we wanted to enclose all the arguments in one method call for better code readability we can:

``` python

from vimbaPy import _pymba

camera = _pymba.getCameraID()
cam = cameras[0]

cam_P = _pymba.createInstance(cam)

# Stream to 'testFrames' with some added feature configuration
cam_P.stream(
	time=10,
	frame_buffer=10,
	callback=cam_P.export,
	features={"ExposureAuto": "Off", "ExposureTime": 5000, "BlackLevel": 0, "Gain": 0},
	path="/home/z/Documents/testFrames/")

```
For continuous acquisition, there are currently two frame handlers implemented: `display` and `export`. These display frames live or export them to a given path respectively. They can be addressed like so:

``` python

# Stream a live view for 10 seconds
cam_P.stream(time=10, frame_buffer=10, callback=cam_P.display)

# Stream frame to disk for 10 seconds
cam_P.stream(time=10, frame_buffer=10, callback=cam_P.export, path="/home/z/Documents/testFrames/")

```

For single frame acquisition, there is currently only support for exporting frames to disk:

``` python

# Acquire a single frame and export to disk
cam_P.acquire_frame(timeout_ms=2000, path="/home/z/Documents/testFrames/", filename="test_1.jpg")

``` 

As with continuous acquisition, we can specify some additional configuration settings:

```python

# Acquire a single frame with an exposure of 5000 (µs)
cam_P.acquire_frame(
	timeout_ms=2000,
	path="/home/z/Documents/testFrames/",
	filename="test_2.jpg",
	features={"ExposureTime": 5000})

```
As with earlier versions, support for configuring camera settings outside of the acquisition methods is still available. Note that there is support for configuring multiple settings at once in addition:

``` python

cam_P.setSingleFeature(feature="ExposureTime", value=5000, verbose=True)

cam_P.setMultiFeature(
	features={"ExposureAuto": "Off",
			  "ExposureTime": 5000, 
			  "BlackLevel": 0,
			  "Gain": 0,
			  "Width": 1600,
			  "Height": 1200},
	verbose=True)

```

## Detailed documentation

Note that unless specified, examples will use the camera instances specified at the beginning of this section. In addition, the naming of specific camera instances is only for clarity on which wrapper is being used under the hood. Lastly, methods for either module can be addressed using the same names. 

### getCameraID()

Obtain the ID's of all connected Allied Vision cameras. ID's are returned as a list.

**Arguments:**

NA

**Example usage**

``` python
from vimbaPy import _pymba, VimbaPython

# For pymba
cameras_P = _pymba.getCameraID()

# For VimbaPython
cameras_VP = _VimbaPython.getCameraID()

```

### createInstance()

### acquire_frame

Acquire a frame and export to a given path. The path argument is optional for users who would like to export to a specific path. If left empty, the frame will be exported to the path specified in the given instance. This will be the current working directory if you did not specify a path when creating the instance or set a new path with `setPath()`.
